# Zeth - Zerocash on Ethereum

:rotating_light: **WARNING** This project is a Proof of Concept. It is highly inefficient and has not been thoroughly reviewed. Please do not use in production!

**Disclaimer:** This work is inspired from [babyzoe](https://github.com/zcash-hackworks/babyzoe), [Miximus](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/miximus.git).
It follows and extends the design presented in [zerocash-ethereum](https://github.com/AntoineRondelet/zerocash-ethereum) by adapting some code initially written by [Zcash](https://github.com/zcash/zcash).

:point_right: Check our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00905.pdf), and the [protocol specifications](https://github.com/clearmatics/zeth-specifications) for more information about Zeth.

## Building and running the project:

:computer: **Warning** This project primarily targets x86_64 Linux and macOS platforms.

### Environment

In order to follow the README below, you will need:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (at least version `6.4.1`)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (at least version `v9.5.0`)
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (at least version `3.7`)
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (at least version `19.0.2`)

Additionally, several tools from the GCC and LLVM tools suite are used to improve code quality and generate the documentation of the project. These are required in order to compile the project with all options enabled:
- [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/)
- [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
- [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/)
- [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/)
- [include-what-you-use](https://include-what-you-use.org/)
- [llvm-symbolizer](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-symbolizer.html)

To use the Zeth functionality, 3 components are required:
- An Ethereum network (the commands below use a local testnet) to host the Zeth
  contracts and handle transactions.
- A running "prover_server" process, used by Zeth clients to generate proofs.
- Client tools, which generate all inputs required for a Zeth operations,
  request proofs from the "prover_server", and transmit transactions to the
  Ethereum network holding the Zeth contract.

We use 3 terminals, one for each of the above components.

Note: Mac users should increase docker runtime memory from 2gb to 4gb to allow Terminal 1 to complete successfully.

#### Terminal 1:

We propose 2 alternatives to run the `prover_server` below.

##### Fetch the prover_server image (recommended)

```bash
docker pull clearmatics/zeth-prover:latest
docker run -ti -p 50051:50051 --name prover zeth-prover:latest prover_server
```

##### Build and run the prover_server in the development container

```bash
# Clone this repository:
git clone git@github.com:clearmatics/zeth.git
cd zeth

# Pull the zeth-base image (built from `Dockerfile-base`)
docker pull clearmatics/zeth-base:latest
# Build the zeth-dev image
docker build -f Dockerfile-zeth -t zeth-dev .
# Start the zeth development container
docker run -ti -p 50051:50051 --name zeth zeth-dev:latest

# All the commands below are run in the docker container
# Configure your environment
. ./setup_env.sh

# Compile the proving server
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. [<flags (see below)>]
# Compile all libraries and tools, including the prover_server
make
# (optional) Run the unit tests
make test
# (optional) Run the all tests (unit tests, syntax checks, etc)
make check

# Start the prover_server process
prover_server
```

Note: By default, `prover_server` generates a key at startup. Flags can be used
to force the server to load and/or save keys. Run `src/prover_server --help`
for more details.

##### Build Options

Some flags to the `cmake` command can control the build configuration.
`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` or `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` can be used to force
a release or debug build.

By default, zeth makes use of the GROTH16 zk-snark. To chose a different
zksnark run the following: ``` cmake -DZETH_SNARK=$ZKSNARK .. ``` where
`$ZETH_SNARK` is `PGHR13` (see https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/279,
http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879) or `GROTH16`(see
https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260).

#### Terminal 2: Ethereum testnet

```bash
# Start the ethereum test net by running the following commands
cd zeth_contracts

# If the install below fails with python errors, try running:
npm config set python python2.7

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start a local Ethereum testnet
npm run testrpc
```

#### Terminal 3: Python client

```bash
# Configure your environment
. ./setup_env.sh

cd client
```

Follow the steps described in the [client README](client/README.md) to run
tests or invoke the zeth tools.

## Secure Multi Party Computation for the Groth16 SRS generation

See [MPC for SRS generation documentation](mpc/README.md)

## Development dependencies (for building outside of the Docker container)

Immediate dependencies are provided as submodules and compiled during
the Zeth build. Ensure submodules are synced.

The following libraries are also required to build:

- grpc
- gmp
- boost
- openssl

## Generate the Doxygen documentation

To generate the documentation of Zeth:
```bash
cd build
cmake .. -DGEN_DOC=ON && make docs
```

## Compile the project using 'sanitizers'

You can select the sanitizer of your choice (one of the sanitizers listed [here](./cmake/sanitizers.cmake)) by passing the flag `-DSANITIZER=<sanitizer>` to `cmake`.

Example:
```bash
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++ -DSANITIZER=Address -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make check
```

## Run analysis tools on the code

Several tools can be ran on the code. These can be enabled via a set of compilation options.

Note: The `clang-tidy` target runs a clang-tidy python script that should be fetched from [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/master/clang-tools-extra/clang-tidy/tool/run-clang-tidy.py). To do so, run: `cd build && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llvm/llvm-project/master/clang-tools-extra/clang-tidy/tool/run-clang-tidy.py`

Example:
```bash
# run-clang-tidy.py needs to be in the PATH to be found
PATH=$PATH:${PWD}
chmod +x run-clang-tidy.py

cmake -DUSE_CLANG_FORMAT=ON -DUSE_CPP_CHECK=ON -DUSE_CLANG_TIDY=ON ..
make cppcheck
make clang-format
make clang-tidy
```

## Generate code coverage report

1. Make sure to enable the `CODE_COVERAGE` option in the CMake configuration.
2. Compile the tests
```bash
cd build && cmake -DCODE_COVERAGE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. && make check
```
3. Generate the coverage report:
```bash
make coverage
```

**Note:** In order to generate the coverage reports, you will need `lcov`, along with `genhtml` and `xdg-open`.
