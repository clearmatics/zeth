# Zeth - Zerocash on Ethereum

:rotating_light: **WARNING** This project is a Proof of Concept. It is highly inefficient and has not been thoroughly reviewed. Please do not use in production!

**Disclaimer:** This work is inspired from [babyzoe](https://github.com/zcash-hackworks/babyzoe), [Miximus](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/miximus.git).
It follows and extends the design presented in [zerocash-ethereum](https://github.com/AntoineRondelet/zerocash-ethereum) by adapting some code initially written by [Zcash](https://github.com/zcash/zcash).

:point_right: Check our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00905.pdf) for more information about Zeth.

## Building and running the project:

### Environment

In order to follow the README below, you will need:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (at least version `6.4.1`)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (at least version `v9.5.0`)
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (at least version `3.6.3`)

We use 3 terminals to run the project.
One terminal will be used to run the proving service/server, another one will be used to run a local Ethereum testnet, and the final terminal will be used to run a python stub that triggers a few proof generations on the proving server in order to do confidential transactions on the Ethereum testnet.

The titles of the sections below are prefixed with the terminal ID the commands should be ran into.

#### Terminal 1: Configure the project and run the cpp tests (Docker)

```bash
# Clone this repository:
git clone git@github.com:clearmatics/zeth.git
cd zeth

# Pull the zeth-base image (built from `Dockerfile-base`)
docker pull clearmatics/zeth-base:latest
# Build the zeth-dev image
docker build -f Dockerfile-zeth -t zeth-dev .
# Start the zeth development container
docker run -ti -p 50051:50051 --name zeth zeth-dev:latest

## All the commands below are ran in the docker container
# Configure your environment
. ./setup_env.sh

# Compile the proving server
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
## (optional) Run the tests
make check # Builds and run the tests (once the tests are built, calling "make test" suffices to execute them)
## Compile
make

# Start the proving server
prover_server
```

##### Build Options

By default, zeth makes use of GROTH16. To chose a different zksnark run the following:
```
cmake -DZKSNARK=$ZKSNARK ..
```
where `$ZKSNARK` is `PGHR13`(see https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/279, http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879) or `GROTH16`(see https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260).

#### Terminal 2: Start an Ethereum testnet to test the smart contracts

```bash
# Start the ethereum test net by running the following commands
cd zeth-contracts

# If the install below fails with python errors, try running:
npm config set python python2.7

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start a local Ethereum testnet
npm run testrpc
```

#### Terminal 3: Start the testing Python stub

```bash
# Configure your environment
. ./setup_env.sh

cd pyClient
# Follow the few steps described in the README of the python stub
```

### Use the pyClient or the jsClient

This Proof of Concept comes with some minimal building blocks to integrate Zeth with your applications.
You can use the python and/or the javascript clients to interact with the proving service and request proofs on a given `(instance, witness)` pair.

If you do not know where to start, you can just follow the instructions of the README in `pyClient` to run one of the `testEtherMixing.py` or `testERCTokenMixing.py` script.
These scripts implement a scenario where Alice, Bob and Charlie do confidential transfers using Ether and an ERC20 token, respectively.

**Note:** These clients are very minimal and only used for testing purpose!
